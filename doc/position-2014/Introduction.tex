\section{Introduction}

Resource management (RM) software is critical
for high performance computing (HPC).
It is the centerpiece that allows efficient
execution of HPC applications while providing
the computing facility with the main means
to maximize the utilization of its computing
resources.

However, several growing trends make even
best-in-breed RM software systems increasingly ineffective.
As numbers and types of compute cores of
HPC systems continue to grow, the key RM challenges associated only
with today's leadership-class machines are quickly
permeating to {\em all} computing resources
such as commodity Linux clusters. Thus the RM must increase
its purview to resources across the entire
computing facility to have to provide 
extreme scalability, low noise, fault tolerance,
and heterogeneity management while under increasingly
stricter power bounds.

In fact, a greater interplay among various classes
of clusters across the entire computing facility already 
makes the current paradigm of single-cluster scheduling
largely ineffective. An application running on a compute
cluster heavily utilizes site-wide shared resources
such as I/O and visualization clusters.
Thus, avoiding any significant site-wide bottleneck
requires the RM to schedule the job to all dependent
resources together.

Meanwhile, greater difficulties in code development
on larger systems have begun to impose far more complex
requirements on the RM. For example, without adequate
RM support, debugging, tuning, testing and verification
of the applications have become too difficult
and time-consuming for end-users.
The next-generation code development environments
require the RM to provide effective mechanisms
to support the reproducible results of program execution,
to provide accurate correlations between user-level errors
and system-level events,
and to integrate and accelerate a rich set of scalable tools.

In short, without the RM that can effectively
address all of these challenges, it has become apparent
that HPC centers will suffer a significant loss
in both user productivity and efficient uses of its
next-generation computing resources. 

Our response to this critical need is \flux,
an RM software framework that can solve the key emerging
challenges in a simple, extensible, distributed
and autonomous fashion.
It aims at managing the whole computing facility
as one common pool of diverse resources.
Hence, scheduling decisions will be far more efficient
as well as extendible to accommodate emerging constraints
such as a strict power bound.

Further, \flux\ integrates system monitoring and
administration, lightweight virtualization, 
and distributed tool communication capabilities 
that are currently provided by disjoint
and often overlapping software. 
Integration of these facilities within the common framework
designed from the ground up for scalability, security,
and fault tolerance will result in a more efficient
and capable system.
