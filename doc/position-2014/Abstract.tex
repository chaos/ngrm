Resource and job management software is crucial 
to High Performance Computing (HPC) for efficient application execution. 
However, current systems and approaches can no longer keep up with the challenges 
large HPC centers are facing
%centers are faced with major 
%resource and job management challenges that stem from 
due to
ever-increasing system scales, resource and workload 
diversity, interplays between various resources 
(e.g., between compute clusters and a global 
file system), and complexity of resource constraints 
such as strict power budgeting. 
%In this paper, we 
%argue for a new resource and job management paradigm 
%that can effectively address these emerging challenges
%under one common software framework.
To address this gap,
we propose \flux, an extensible job and resource management framework 
specifically designed to deal with the requirements of next-generation HPC centers.
%
%that can embody this new paradigm
%in a simple, extensible, distributed, and autonomous fashion.
\flux targets an entire computing facility as one common pool
of diverse sets of resources enabling the facility to accommodate
site-wide constraints (e.g., for power limits). Yet, its scalable
and distributed design still  
offers scalable and effective scheduling strategies. 
%as well as flexible accommodation of site-wide constraints.
%Further, its run-time system is designed to support the 
%new paradigm, providing high scalability and user 
%productivity. 
This paper details the design of \flux and describes and evaluates
our initial 
prototyping effort of the key run-time components. 
Our results show that our run-time prototype 
provides strong and predictable scalability.
