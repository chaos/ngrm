Resource and job management software is crucial 
to HPC for efficient application execution. 
However, today's HPC centers are faced with major 
resource and job management challenges that stem from 
ever-increasing system scales, resource and workload 
diversity, interplays between various resources 
(e.g., between compute clusters and a global 
file system), and complexity of resource constraints 
such as strict power budgeting. In this paper, we 
argue for a new resource and job management paradigm 
that can effectively address these emerging challenges
under one common software framework.
We then propose \flux\, our software framework that can embody this new paradigm
in a simple, extensible, distributed, and autonomous fashion.
\flux\ targets an entire computing facility as one common pool
of diverse sets of resources, yet still can 
offer scalable and effective scheduling strategies 
as well as flexible accommodation of site-wide constraints.
Further, its run-time system is designed to support the 
new paradigm, providing high scalabilty and user 
productivity. This paper details our initial 
prototyping effort on developing key run-time components. 
Our results show that our run-time prototype 
provides strong and predictable scalability.
