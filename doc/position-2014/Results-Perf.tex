\section{Results}
\label{sec:results}
%One of the most important initial goals of \flux\ is to gain
%a fundamental understanding of key design challenges pertaining
%to our conceptual models.
%In the context of \flux's run-time system, the scalability
%and productivity
%challenges---as described in Section~\ref{label:paradigm}---are especially
%relevant and crucial. 
%Clearly, we  must provide a wide range
%of run-time elements such as parallel programming models,
%tools and middleware with performance, scalability, easy integration
%and interoperability.
%This section evaluates our prototype's performance
%and scalability characteristics.
% as well as its ability
%to support tools that improve user productivity.
