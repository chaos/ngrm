\section{Results}
\label{sec:results}
One of the most important initial goals of \flux\ is to gain
a fundamental understanding of key design challenges pertaining
to our conceptual models.
In the context of \flux's run-time system, the scalability
and productivity
challenges---as described in Section~\ref{sect:challenges}---are especially
relevant and crucial. 
%Clearly, we  must provide a wide range
%of run-time elements such as parallel programming models,
%tools and middleware with performance, scalability, easy integration
%and interoperability.
Thus, this section evaluates our prototype's performance
and scalability characteristics as well as its ability
to support various productivity software programs.
