\section{Related Work}

MrNet~\cite{mrnet} implements a tree-based overlay network
that parallel debugging tools have used to great advantage.
The work of the MrNet team influenced our early discussions of the
\flux\ communications framework.  A key difference is that the \flux\ CMB
prototype is persistent and can service the needs of multiple tools
concurrently.

Redis~\cite{Redis} is a key value store frequently employed in internet
services.  Its simplicity and power are fascinating
and our experience experimenting with it influenced our thoughts on
what a key value store should and shouldn't be.  At the time of
this writing, Redis cluster is a work in progress.  To explore
Redis scalability we combined it with twemproxy~\cite{Twemproxy} and
tried various schemes for sharding and replicating the key space.
Ultimately we decided that our requirements for security and fault
tolerance would be better served if the \flux\ distributed KVS could
utilize the CMB persistent overlay networks and embarked on our own design.
