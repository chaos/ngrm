\subsection{Approach}

The \flux\ team has charted its course through a series of steps
meant to inform our design of the production version of a new
RM framework.  We began with a paper design that included an
internal review with developers at the operating systems level
as well as run-time and applications level, as well as other
stakeholders.  We then developed prototypes of the communication
framework and built services on top of that. We defined and completed
a milestone for launching an application using lightweight jobs,
with MPI and a debugger, making use of the Flux framework.

We have focused on the common scalable persistent communications
infrastructure and a key value store that we determined to be
an essential building block of the framework.
There are several other building blocks that we think are essential
and that have evolved our design and understanding of the challenges
(and the model?).

\marginpar{\tiny BS: Do you want to now make a case for why KVS is going
to be an important building block?  Or just launch into the next
two sections on CMB and KVS?}
